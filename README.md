## 📘 Reddit Comment Sentiment Analysis
A complete end-to-end Machine Learning project that classifies Reddit comments into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiment.
This repository includes data preprocessing, EDA, DVC pipelines, ML model training, CI/CD, Docker deployment, and production-ready scripts.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project follows a production-grade MLOps workflow:
1)Automated data versioning using DVC  

2)Modular ML training pipeline

3)Full NLP preprocessing pipeline

4)TF-IDF vectorization

5)Multiple ML models (LR, SVM, RF, XGBoost)

6)Hyperparameter tuning

7)Automated evaluation

8)Docker container for deployment

9)CI/CD pipeline for automated build + deploy

## Pipeline stages 
### clean – clean raw Reddit comments
### preprocess – tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
### vectorize – convert text into TF-IDF features
### train – train ML model
### evaluate – evaluate and log metric
### push – push model & data versions to remote storage


## 📂 Folder Structure
The project is designed to be fully reproducible and deployment-ready.
